<!-- Program generates a random number between 1 and 100, then asks the user to 
make a guess as to what the number is. If the user guessed correctly, the program 
says that they win, and to enter another number to play again. If the user guesses too high, 
the program says that they guessed too high, if the user guesses too low. the program says
 that they guessed too high. Program repeats until correct number is guessed.
